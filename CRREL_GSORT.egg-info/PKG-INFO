        The Cold Regions Reserach and Engineering Lab Geometric Optics Snow Radiative Transfer model (CRREL-GOSRT)
        is a unique snow radiative transfer model that combines 3D microCT snow renderings with ray-tracing and a generalized photon-tracking model to simulate snow
        optical properties and snow albedo, transmissivity, and absorption at wavelengths between 350 - 1350nm (visible and NIR). Typical usage
        often looks like this::
        
            #!/usr/bin/env python
        
            from crrelGOSRT import SlabModel, PhotonTrack
        
        
            Slab=SlabModel.SlabModel(namelist='namelist.txt')
            Slab.Initialize()
        
            WaveLength=np.arange(400,1300,50)
            Zenith=60
            Azi=0
            nPhotons=10000
            Albedo, Absorption,Transmiss,transmissionDict=Slab.GetSpectralAlbedo(WaveLength,Zenith,Azi,nPhotons=nPhotons)
        
        
        Paragraphs are separated by blank lines. *Italics*, **bold**,
        and ``monospace`` look like this.

        -------------
        
        Numbered lists look like you'd expect:
        
        1. Generate 3D rendering of snow micro structure (not incorporated in the model)
        
        2. Compute optical properties from microCT rendering for use in 1D Slab Spectral Albeod Model
        
        3. Simulate Snow Albedo, Transmissivity, Absorption using 1D photon tracking model with optical properties computed from step 2.
