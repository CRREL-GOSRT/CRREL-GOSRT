### File Paths and Names ###

### This namelist is provided as an example for loading the optical properties associated with the fine grain sample discussed in the
### Letcher et al. 20201 Manuscript.  Note that the user will need to set all the paths to the data and the optical properties files as 
### required.  Lat/Lon isn't used for this example, unless the diffuse fraction is changed, and GetZenith() is called.
